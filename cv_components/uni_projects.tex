    \rightsideplain{The specific challenge focused on the topic: A forensic camera model identification challenge. The goal of this competition was to build a system capable of determining the type of camera (manufacturer and model) that captured a digital image without relying on metadata. We developed a system based on machine learning techniques that could identify the camera type with an accuracy of 71\%. \vspace{15pt}}

    I work in:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item the H2020 funded project InSilc (\url{https://insilc.eu/}) in which my main responsibilities relate to the design and implementation of algorithmic approaches for the registration of IVUS images before and after stent procedure.
      \item the H2020 funded project SeeFar (\url{https://www.see-far.eu/}) on the development and evaluation of methods for the detection and the progression of retina diseases (diabetic retinopathy and  age-related macular degeneration), as well as diseases that are not related with the eyes health, but signs of the diseases can be detected by the analysis of retina images (e.g. cardiovascular risk). Both traditional (featured based) machine learning approaches as well as deep learning methods will be explored and evaluated  with respect to accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis and prediction.
    \end{enumerate}
